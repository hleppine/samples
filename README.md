# samples
Code samples.

See README files in subdirectories.

Some of the samples are really old (from the last 10 years or so), so don't really remember all the details anymore.

I noticed I don't have anything to show in Python, even though that would be my language of choice nowadays for almost everything unless some other language would be specifically needed (like C for low-level embedded). Python is powerful & fast to write, and by putting tools such as Python Black, mypy, and Pylint in CI ensures the Python code stays maintainable.
