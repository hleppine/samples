- coffeesim: Adaptation of the coffee file system from Contiki OS, it uses a file on disk to simulate (storage only) a block of flash. IIRC Coffee was investigated for Aalto-2 but not taken into use. Tests seem to pass when compiling and running this.
- cyclic_executive: This was a very simple investigation of programming Arduino with Eclipse as the IDE, and flashing the Arduino via the command line. Probably intended to investigate a cyclic executive approach, but didn't really work on it really far. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_executive
- ds: Started to develop for myself a library of MISRA C -compliant basic data structures in C that don't use e.g. malloc and that could be used in embedded systems. These would be components with a permissive license (e.g. Unlicense) that would be easy to drag-and-drop into a project. Note that there's only three items here but the same pattern could be followed, e.g. hash tables, linked lists (intrusive and non-intrusive), red-black trees could be added. Also investigated a bit using cppcheck for MISRA C:2012 checking, also refreshed how doxygen works and how to use clang-format in VSCode to autoformat the C code.
- pawnsim: Investigated using the Pawn scripting language with the Hercules microcontrollers. This was investigated for Aalto-2 IIRC but not taken into use.
