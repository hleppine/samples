- gmat_generator: MATLAB utilities to create GMAT scenarios from Aalto-1 TLEs, or from Aalto-1 GPS measurements. GMAT is a mission analysis tool from NASA, something like STK but much more bare-bones. Would have made more sense to implement this e.g. in Python (can't run it anymore as I don't have MATLAB access right now), however not sure if some of those astrodynamics functions are available in Python (maybe they weren't at least in 2015).
